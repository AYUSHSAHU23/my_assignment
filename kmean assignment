*What is K-means clustering?*
Ans- KMeans groups similar data together into "clusters."

How is the initial value of the centroids usually determined in K-means clustering?
Ans- The initial values of centroids in K-means clustering can significantly impact the final clustering results,
as the algorithm may converge to different local optima based on the initial centroid placements. 
There are several common methods for initializing the centroids:
